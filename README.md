# Design Patterns using Java

We know as developers that it is very common to come across refactorings, migrations from monoliths to microservices and what can we use to make these migrations more efficient? That's right Design Patterns.
In this class you will show a compilation of learning solutions with examples from the book: Reusable Software Patterns for a GOF Project Object, and the more background-oriented, what applies, and how creational patterns behave. This class is the first of a series, in which the next ones will be the location of the background in each pattern.
